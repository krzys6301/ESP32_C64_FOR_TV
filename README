THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE 

![Alt text](/PHOTO/IMG_20220617_014104.jpg?raw=true "work in progress")

This is an C64 simulator that runs on single esp32 board, pin 25 is NTSC compiste output and pin 18 is audio.
There is an async http server accessible at port 80, which allows to upload a *.PRG file, and execute some commands on the C64 "console" screen, eg. issue RUN or LIST command.
There is WiFi manager installed, so after first you need to connect to wifi network "EPS_32" and setup the WiFi connection, if the esp remebers some wifi from previous project then it will probably connect autmatically.
There is also OTA for over-the-air updates - handy for quick testing.

Joystick is almost working (not tested in game, but peeking the c64 address 56320 & 56321 "PEEK(56320):PEEK(56321)" is showing that the movements are detected), the pins used are described in iopins.h and emuapi.cpp has a "joySwapped" flag to swap joysticks 1 or 2.
jostick pins:
#define JOY_1_up      12
#define JOY_1_down    14
#define JOY_1_left    5
#define JOY_1_right   4
#define JOY_1_fire    17

there is only one joystick joy1 defined, pin 23 is to swap if it is connectet to port for joy1 or joy2.

I compiled it with arduino 1.8.19 and esp 32 board installed from https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

There are definitively some bugs there, the speed is probably somwhere at 80% of the orginall C64, the vic.cpp is probably the slowest part depending on the screen mode, maybe there are some techniques which I'm not aware of to improve the speed of emulation.
Everyone is welcomed to do some improvements, that's the reason I push this software to git.
This project uses brilliant solutions from several other projects: (in the future I will update the descriptions to a repo link, now just for the record)
reSID
espMCUME
AsyncHttpServer for ESP32
esp_8_bit
bitluni esp32 composite out

without the above projects it wouldn't exist, if you see your open source work in this project and you're not enlisted please let me know, so I can add you here for the fame, thanks and record :)

TODO:
-- check if joystick works
-- add maybe other formats than *.PRG
-- make the emulation faster
-- improve the web console as it sometimes leads the restart of ESP32
-- maybe implement joyPort select (1 or 2) via some jumper on a esp32 pin?
-- any other idea is welcomed


I've tested it with an excellent set of C64 games, that I've downloaded form https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=76305
There path for the *.PRG that works with this simulator is: OneLoad64-Games-Collection-v3\PRGs\Crunched\*.PRG

There is BoulderDash, Paradroid, Frogger etc in this collection, and all of them seem to work, and seems to be playable at current emulation speed.
Some games are much slower, some are quite fast, depends on the way the use the vic chip, the code in vic.cpp can probably be improved.

After each line the vic is drawing it is transformed into more concise format 4bit/pixel, which allows to store information about pixel collor of 16 possible colors in the c64,
the conversion is done by the display.eol() function. Rewriting the vic.cpp to natively write in this format would probably improve performance, but that is much work.
This solution saved quite a lot of ram memory on the frame buffer, and thanks to this there can be more fetures like sound, webserver and OTA.

When this board starts is prints the IP address to the Serial console, the serial speed is 115200.
